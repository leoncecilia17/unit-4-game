# Berry Collector Game 

Welcome to the Berry Collector Game

Please read below to learn how to play: 

When the page loads, the game begins. Each berry will have a specific value. Click on the berries to figure out their values. Each time you click on a berry your total score at the bottom of the page will go up by that amount. Continue to click on the berries until your total score matches the random value generated at the top of the berries. If these two values match, you win! That is the goal. If your score goes over the generated number, you lose! 

Once you win or lose, the page will generate a new number and the berries will have a new value. Continue to click on the berries until you win. 

Good luck! Enjoy.
